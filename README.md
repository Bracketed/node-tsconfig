<h2>What is this?</h2>
- A TypeScript configuration package that is built to reduce the need of having to configure your own tsconfig.json file.
The tsconfig extension is short for "TypeScript configuration file." It's a file that developers create to tell the TypeScript compiler how to compile their code. Think of it like a set of instructions for the compiler to follow.

When you create a tsconfig file, you can specify things like which files to compile, where to put the compiled code, and which version of TypeScript to use. You can also configure advanced settings like how to handle certain types of errors or warnings.

Having a tsconfig file is important because it helps ensure consistency across a project. By having all developers use the same file, everyone will be compiling their code in the same way, which can reduce bugs and make it easier to maintain the code over time.

It's a very essential tool for any TypeScript developer's project.
